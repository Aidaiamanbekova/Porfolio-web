# Porfolio-web

At the begining in my portfolio I introduce myself in HOME section,  it was more convinient to use sections indtead of create a new HTML file, 
a lot of CSS for all sections, classes and id, that also were used in JavaScript. 

CSS file contain different decorations and with JS I add button at Home section, email, you can write me fron the site and animation when user scroll the page.
